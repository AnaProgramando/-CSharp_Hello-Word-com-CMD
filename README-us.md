# 🤗 Welcome

Hello, welcome!

I had the idea to start the #100DaysOfCode challenge, in addition to sharing some projects for those interested in learning C#, so it's something very simple for those who would like to start programming or need to improve their skills.

<br>

📚 Take advantage of the code for this exercise

👩‍💻 Redo it your way

😉 If you have any questions, contact me

<br>

## 📝 Creating the File

1. Create a folder on your computer to place the application.

2. Create a new Text Document and name it without spaces in the title.

3. Copy the following code into your txt file:

###### 💬 Note: Use notepad to edit your file, you don't need an advanced text editor.

```
using System;

class Program
{
	static void Main(string[] args)
	{
		Console.WriteLine("Running Project 1 - Hello World:");
		
		Console.WriteLine("Olá mundo! Hello world!");
		Console.WriteLine("The run has ended.");
		Console.WriteLine("Press Enter to finish...");
		Console.ReadLine();
	}
}
```

<br>

## 📂 Accessing the C# compiler

4. Use your computer's File Explorer to navigate through Windows directories to the Microsoft.NET Framework folder.
- Path where the folder is usually located on the computer: C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework

5. Open the version 4 folder that has the files used by the CLR (common language runtime).

> **Common Language Runtime (CLR) Overview** <br>
> .NET provides a runtime environment, called the Common Language Runtime, that executes code and provides services that facilitate the development process.<br>
> To learn more about CLR, click [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/pt-br/dotnet/standard/clr)!

6. In this folder you will find the csc.exe file, copy the path of this file
- Example: c:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30219\csc.exe

	<br>
	
	> **csc: C Sharp Compiler** <br>

	> **C# Compiler Options** <br>
	> This section describes the options interpreted by the C# compiler. <br>
	> To know more about compiler, click [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/pt-br/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/)

<br>

## 👩‍💻 Compiling the code

7. Press the "Windows" key.

8. Type "cmd".

9. Open Command Prompt.

10. Type in the Prompt: cd "path of the folder where you saved the application" and press Enter.
- Example: cd C:\Users\Fulano\Documents\FolderExercise

11. Paste the path of csc.exe, leave a space, paste the name and extension of your application file and press Enter.
- Example: c:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30219\csc.exe Exercise.txt

	
###### 💬 Note: To confirm that it worked, go to your application's directory with the File Explorer to check if the executable of your code appeared: "Exercise.exe".

<br>

## ▶ Execution

12. To execute with Prompt type the name of the file and press Enter.
- Example: Exercise.exe
- Ready! Now it will be possible to see the execution of your application, because the message that you typed in your code will appear in the Prompt.
	
```
C:\Users\Fulano\Documents\FolderExercise>c:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30219\csc.exe Exercise.txt
Microsoft (R) Visual C# Compiler version 4.8.4084.0
for C# 5
Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

This compiler is provided as part of the Microsoft (R) .NET Framework, but only supports language versions up to C# 5, which is no longer the latest version. For compilers that support newer versions of the C# programming language, see http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=533240


C:\Users\Fulano\Documents\FolderExercise>Exercise.exe
Hello World!
```

###### 💬 Note: If you edit this code, you will need to compile and run it again:
	- c:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30219\csc.exe Exercise.txt
	- Exercise.exe
	
###### ‼ Note 2: Always follow the syntax rules of the language - C# is case sensitive, we must pay attention when writing keywords / reserved words, as some of them must start with capital letters, others with capital letters, and all must be written in exact and correct way for applications to work.
